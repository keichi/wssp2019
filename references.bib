abstract = {A new set of benchmarks has been developed for the performance evaluation of highly parallel supercomputers. These benchmarks consist of five parallel kernels and three simulated application benchmarks. Together they mimic the computation and data movement characteristics of large scale Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applications. The principal distinguishing feature of these benchmarks is their 'pencil and paper' specification-all details of these benchmarks are specified only algorithmically. In this way many of the difficulties associated with conventional benchmarking approaches on highly parallel systems are avoided.},

@article{Jamalian2015,
abstract = {Advances in Cloud Computing attracted scientists to deploy their HPC applications to the cloud to benefit from the flexibility of the platform such as scalability and on-demand services. Nevertheless, HPC programs can face serious challenges in the cloud that could undermine the gained benefits. This paper first compares the performance of several HPC benchmarks on a commodity cluster and Amazon public cloud to illustrate the confronted challenges. To mitigate the problem, we have introduced a novel approach called ASETS, "A SDN Empowered Task Scheduling System", to schedule data-intensive High Performance Computing (HPC) tasks in a Cloud environment. In this paper, we focus on the implementation and performance analysis of ASETS and its first algorithm called SETSA, (SDN Empowered Task Scheduling Algorithm). ASETS uses the "bandwidth awareness" capability of SDN to better utilize the bandwidths when assigning tasks to virtual machines. This approach aims to improve the performance of HPC programs and provides an efficient HPC-as-a-Service (HPCaaS) platform. The paper briefly describes the architecture and the algorithm, and then focuses on the details of the implementation and performance analysis of ASETS and SETSA. Preliminary results indicate that ASETS delivers substantial performance improvement for HPCaaS as the degree of multi-tenancy increases. This result is significant since it indicates both the users and the cloud service providers can benefit from ASETS.},

@article{Kreutz2015,
abstract = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that promises to change this state of affairs, by breaking vertical integration, separating the network's control logic from the underlying routers and switches, promoting (logical) centralization of network control, and introducing the ability to program the network. The separation of concerns introduced between the definition of network policies, their implementation in switching hardware, and the forwarding of traffic, is key to the desired flexibility: by breaking the network control problem into tractable pieces, SDN makes it easier to create and introduce new abstractions in networking, simplifying network management and facilitating network evolution. In this paper we present a comprehensive survey on SDN. We start by introducing the motivation for SDN, explain its main concepts and how it differs from traditional networking, its roots, and the standardization activities regarding this novel paradigm. Next, we present the key building blocks of an SDN infrastructure using a bottom-up, layered approach. We provide an in-depth analysis of the hardware infrastructure, southbound and northbound APIs, network virtualization layers, network operating systems (SDN controllers), network programming languages, and network applications. We also look at cross-layer problems such as debugging and troubleshooting. In an effort to anticipate the future evolution of this new paradigm, we discuss the main ongoing research efforts and challenges of SDN. In particular, we address the design of switches and control platforms -- with a focus on aspects such as resiliency, scalability, performance, security and dependability -- as well as new opportunities for carrier transport networks and cloud providers. Last but not least, we analyze the position of SDN as a key enabler of a software-defined environment.},
