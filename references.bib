@inproceedings{Takahashi2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. In general, modern high-performance computing systems are built as cluster systems. We have been investigating the feasibility of optimizing MPI communications by integrating the dynamic network control realized by SDN. In this paper, we present a concept of a generic SDN enhanced MPI framework, an application-aware network control mechanism specifically for MPI applications.},
