\section{Introduction}

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
including versions of Lorem Ipsum~\cite{Takahashi2014}. including versions of
Lorem Ipsum~\cite{Takahashi2015}. including versions of Lorem
Ipsum~\cite{Takahashi2017}. including versions of Lorem
Ipsum~\cite{Takahashi2018}. including versions of Lorem
Ipsum~\cite{Dashdavaa2014}.


\section{Background}

\subsection{SDN-enhanced MPI}

MPI~\cite{MPIForum2012}

\subsection{Job Scheduler}

A job scheduler is a system that accepts \textit{job} submissions from users and
dispatch the

Examples of job schedulers used in production HPC systems include
Slurm~\cite{Yoo2003}, PBS
Professional\footnote{\url{https://www.pbspro.org/}},
Torque\footnote{\url{https://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/torque/}} and
UNIVA Grid Engine\footnote{\url{http://www.univa.com/products/}}. In this
paper, Slurm is assumed as it is one of the most widely adopted open-source
job schedulers.

Figure~\ref{kt:fig:slurm} shows the architecture of Slurm. Slurm employs a
master-worker architecture like many other job schedulers. The master accepts
job requests from users and

Here, it is assumed
that the cluster has three types of node: login node, head node and compute
node.

Like many job
schedulers, Slurm employs a master-worker architecture, where the master
accepts from

\subsection{Challenges and Goal}

\section{Proposal}

\subsection{Overview}

Figure~\ref{kt:fig:architecture} shows the overall architecture of the
proposed SDN-enhanced MPI framework.

The scheduler plugin and the interconnect manager use
gRPC\footnote{\url{https://grpc.io/}} to communicate with one another. We have
chosen gRPC, which is an RPC framework built on top of HTTP/2, because it
can automatically generate server and client based on the interface
definition.

    \label{kt:fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Interconnect Manager}

The interconnect manager is responsible for computing and installing optimal
routes for each job.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Receiving notifications from srun and slurmd
    \item Persisting the state of jobs to a database
    \item Computing routes
    \item Installing routes to interconnect by talking to the OpenFlow
        controller.
\end{itemize}


The builtin REST API server of Ryu.

\subsection{Scheduler Plugin}

The scheduler plugin is responsible for

-

Slurm provides a plugin mechanism called Slurm Plug-in Architecture for Node
and job Control (SPANK). SPANK

Furthermore,

This plugin is inserted into srun and slurmd

srun: Sends job ID, name, uid/gid of user, number of tasks and communication
pattern name to the interconnect manager when a job is submitted.
slurmd: Sends job id, MPI rank, node ID and node name to interconnect manager
when a process consisting a job starts or exits. Blocks until the routings
have been setup in the interconnect.
